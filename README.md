# Hello World

Hi, so I saw a challenge in the now very popular Noob coder group founded by youtuber [Samuel Miller](https://www.youtube.com/c/SamMillerVlogs).

The challenge is quite simple - make the funniest way you can write a hello world program.

I don't know about funny, but this way is sure to be one of the most overkill ways to write a hello world program.

## Methodology

Ever heard of the amazing way to make API's in Python - [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).

I made two API's in Flask, one in the root directory of the server (no idea if this is what you call the ```route('/')```) and one to get a hello world response back.

You can see the API implementation in the [```API/```]()
